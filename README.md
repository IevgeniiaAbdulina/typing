With this project I've learned/improved:

- Handling User Input
- Conditional Display
- Character by Character Comparison
- Property Binding

### Built With

- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.1.
- Deploy with [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com) version 30.2.3.
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/): the modern CSS framework.
- [Faker library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker/v/5.5.3) version faker@5.5.3 - randomly generate a sentence.

## Features

- Randomly Generate a sentence.
- Display each character, but color it:
  - green: it's right;
  - red: it's wrong;
  - grey: a given character hasn't been entered yet;
- If the user enters the correct text, show the 'Success!' message.
